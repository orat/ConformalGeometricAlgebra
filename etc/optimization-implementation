conformal geometric
algebra requires a fast engine for multiplying multivectors. One way to achieve
this is to encode each multivector via its matrix representation. For the impor-
tant case of G(4, 1) this representation consists of 4 Ã— 4 complex matrices. But
in general this approach is slower than algorithms designed to take advantage
of the unique properties of geometric algebra.
