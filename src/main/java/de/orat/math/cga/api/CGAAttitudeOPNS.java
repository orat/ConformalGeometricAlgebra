/**
 * Attitudes, also called free or direction vectors (directions),  free k-blades 
 * are elements without position. 
 * 
 * They are made by wedging any Euclidean element (vector, bivector, or 
 * trivector) with âˆž. Directions are invariant under translations 
 * (they do not change if moved), but they can of course be rotated.

 * They represent directions without a location. They are translation 
 * invariant but rotation covariant.
 * 
 * This means there is no e0-component in its formula.
 * 
 * This is the base class for all attitude classes (Vector, Bivector, TreeVector).
