/**
 * Part of the reason rounds can be so elegantly combined is that they contain tan-
 * gent elements. Pure tangents have zero size but a finite weight. They are created
 * by wedging any Euclidean element (vector, bivector, or trivector) with the origin o.
 * We explore uses of tangent vectors as generators at the origin of the form ot in Sec-
 * tion 4. Translation of such elements returns an element very similar to a Point Pair.
 * Future work will require more rigorous examination of tangent bivectors, which are
 * closely related to circles, to generate implicit surfaces, and pure tangent trivectors
 * as zero-sized spheres to generate implicit volumes.
